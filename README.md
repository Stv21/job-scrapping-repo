# Job Scraper - Internship Assessment

A comprehensive Python web scraper that extracts job listings from multiple sources and stores them in a PostgreSQL database. This project demonstrates both static scraping using GraphQL APIs and dynamic content extraction using Selenium.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This scraper is designed to fulfill the requirements of the International Credit Score internship assessment. It implements a two-part scraping approach:

1. **Part 2: Static Scraping** - Uses requests to interact with job board APIs and HTML parsing
2. **Part 3: Dynamic Scraping** - Uses Selenium to extract detailed job descriptions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL** - Database storage
- **Requests** - HTTP client for API calls
- **BeautifulSoup** - HTML parsing
- **Selenium** - Dynamic content scraping
- **psycopg2** - PostgreSQL adapter
- **webdriver-manager** - Automatic ChromeDriver management

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Database Setup
1. **Install PostgreSQL** on your system
2. **Create database and user**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE internship_assessment;
   CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE internship_assessment TO myuser;
   ```

### Python Environment
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone/Download the Project
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd job-scraper-assessment
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Database Connection
Update `config.ini` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
```ini
[postgresql]
host = localhost
port = 5432
dbname = internship_assessment
user = myuser
password = mypassword
```

### 4. Verify Database Connection
Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible with the provided credentials.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Scraper

### Basic Execution
```bash
python scraper.py
```

### What the Script Does

#### Part 1: Database Setup
- Automatically creates the `job_listings` table if it doesn't exist
- Table structure matches the assessment requirements

#### Part 2: Job Listings Scraping
- Searches for "Data Analyst", "Python Developer", "Data Scientist", and "Business Analyst" positions
- Extracts: Job Title, Company Name, Location, Salary Info, Job URL
- Stores data in PostgreSQL with `job_description` initially set to NULL
- Uses fallback mechanisms for reliable data collection

#### Part 3: Job Description Scraping
- Queries database for jobs without descriptions
- Uses Selenium to navigate to each job URL
- Implements WebDriverWait for dynamic content loading
- Updates job descriptions in the database

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_listings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    job_title VARCHAR(255),
    company_name VARCHAR(255),
    location VARCHAR(255),
    job_url VARCHAR(512) UNIQUE,
    salary_info TEXT,
    job_description TEXT,
    source_site VARCHAR(100),
    scraped_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Robust Scraping Strategy
The scraper uses multiple approaches for reliability:
- **Primary**: Direct API integration where possible
- **Fallback**: HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup
- **Demo Data**: Sample job listings for demonstration when external sources are unavailable

### Anti-Detection Measures
- Browser-like headers and user agents
- Respectful request timing (2-second delays)
- Proper error handling for rate limiting
- No login required (as per assessment requirements)

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Database Errors**: Transaction rollback on conflicts
- **Selenium Errors**: Fallback content extraction strategies
- **Data Validation**: Handles missing or malformed data

## 📈 Expected Output

### Console Output
```
🚀 Starting Job Scraper Assessment
==================================================
✅ Database connection established
✅ Database table setup complete

📊 Part 2: Scraping job listings...
🔍 Starting to scrape job listings for: Data Analyst, Python Developer, Data Scientist, Business Analyst
✅ Successfully scraped 5 job listings
✅ Successfully inserted 5 jobs into database
✅ Part 2 Complete: 5 jobs scraped and stored

🎯 Part 3: Scraping job descriptions...
🚀 Starting dynamic scraping for job descriptions...
📋 Found 5 jobs needing descriptions
🔍 Scraping description for job ID 1
✅ Updated job 1
...
✅ Successfully updated 5 job descriptions
✅ Part 3 Complete: Job descriptions updated

🎉 Assessment Complete!
Database has been populated with job listings and descriptions.
✅ Database connection closed
```

### Database Results
After successful execution, your `job_listings` table will contain:
- 5 job listings with complete information
- UK and remote-friendly positions (London, Manchester, Edinburgh)
- Salary information where available
- Full job descriptions extracted via Selenium
- Data from WeWorkRemotely source

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Database Contents
```sql
-- View all scraped jobs
SELECT id, job_title, company_name, location, source_site, scraped_at 
FROM job_listings 
ORDER BY scraped_at DESC;

-- Check jobs with descriptions
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_jobs,
       COUNT(job_description) as jobs_with_descriptions
FROM job_listings;

-- View salary information
SELECT job_title, company_name, salary_info 
FROM job_listings 
WHERE salary_info != 'Not specified';
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices Implemented

### Code Quality
- **Modular Design**: Organized into logical methods and classes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Documentation**: Detailed comments and docstrings
- **Configuration**: Externalized database credentials

### Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **Credential Management**: Configuration file separation
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful scraping intervals

### Data Integrity
- **Duplicate Prevention**: UNIQUE constraint on job URLs
- **Data Validation**: Proper null handling
- **Transaction Management**: Commit/rollback on errors

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Error
```
❌ Error connecting to database: could not connect to server
```
**Solution**: Verify PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct

#### ChromeDriver Issues
```
❌ Error setting up Selenium driver
```
**Solution**: The script auto-downloads ChromeDriver, but ensure Chrome browser is installed

#### No Jobs Scraped
```
⚠️ Part 2: No jobs were scraped
```
**Solution**: Check internet connection and try running again (API might be temporarily unavailable)

### Validation Script
Run the included test script to verify setup:
```bash
python test_setup.py
```
